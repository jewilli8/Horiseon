# Horiseon


##Description
The goal of this project was to refactor the homepage of a marketing agency using semenatic HTML elements to improve acessibility. Acessibility was further enhanced through the use of alt tags within img elements and the use of correcly functioning links. The existing CSS styles were also consolidated and organized to compliment the semantic structure.
